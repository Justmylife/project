## Frank's Blog

The Jekyll files of this blog are stored on [GitLab.com](http://www.gitlab.com). As I am updating the theme, the Jekyll source will not provide at this time.

## Old Jekyll themes

Several Jekyll themes I have been used. You can fork them if you like.

### Vanbein's Blog (Demo1)

This is the very first one that I used, and now it's maintained by my friend [Vanbein](http://www.vanbein.com/).

Also, you can find the demo at [demo1.flinhong.com](http://demo1.flinhong.com)

If you feel like this theme, you can fork it via [https://git.coding.net/flinhong/Jekyll-Demo1.git](https://git.coding.net/flinhong/Jekyll-Demo1.git).

### Demo2

Then, a simple one was used for a while, and still used for my News site. You can find the demo at [demo2.flinhong.com](http://demo2.flinhong.com)

If you feel like this theme, you can fork it via [https://git.coding.net/flinhong/Jekyll-Demo2.git](https://git.coding.net/flinhong/Jekyll-Demo2.git).
